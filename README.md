# ActiveRecord::SimpleSlave

Provide a simple way to query a slave server (tested only with mysql2 adapter).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-simple-slave'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install activerecord-simple-slave

## Usage

SimpleSlave automatically retrieve authentication informations from your current
database configuration, you only have to provide

Declare in your `database.yml` file the slave address to use:
```yml
development:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3306
  username: root
  password: root
  simple_slave_url: mysql2://slave.localhost:3306 # port is optional
```

You can also use the environment variable `DATABASE_SIMPLE_SLAVE_URL` to declare
your slave server address.
```shell
# EXPORT ENV VAR GLOBALLY
export DATABASE_SIMPLE_SLAVE_URL=mysql2://slave.localhost:3306
bundle exec rails server

# OR PER COMMAND :)
DATABASE_SIMPLE_SLAVE_URL=mysql2://slave.localhost:3306 bundle exec rails server
```

Extend your model with ActiveRecord::SimpleSlave module, then use :
```ruby
class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend ActiveRecord::SimpleSlave
end

Model.with_slave do
  Model.first # this will hit your slave server
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
